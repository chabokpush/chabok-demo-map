Chabok Demo Map Tracker

## Getting Started
Installation
```bash
npm install
```
Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine. You can use nvm to easily switch Node versions between different projects.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


```bash
npm build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment
npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file.
